# Prime Number Checker

A simple Python program to check if a user-input number is a prime number.

## Features
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input is a valid number and prompts the user to re-enter if invalid.
- **Prime Number Logic**: Determines if a number is prime using a while loop to test divisibility.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Displays whether the entered number is a prime or not in an intuitive format.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. If the input is not numeric, the user is asked to re-enter a valid number.
3. The program then checks if the number is:
   - Greater than 1.
   - Not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
4. The result is displayed as either "Yes, Prime Number" or "No, Not a Prime Number."
